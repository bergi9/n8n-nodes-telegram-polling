# n8n-nodes-starter

This template repository contains example nodes to help you get started building your own custom integrations for [n8n](n8n.io).

To make your custom node available to the community, you must create it as an npm package, and [submit it to the npm registry](https://docs.npmjs.com/packages-and-modules/contributing-packages-to-the-registry).

## Using this starter

1. [Generate a new repository](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-nodes-starter/generate) from this template repository
2. Refer to our [documentation on creating nodes](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/creating-nodes/).
3. Open the project in your editor.
4. Browse the examples in `/nodes`. Modify the examples, or replace them with your own nodes.
5. Update the `package.json` to match your details.
6. Run `npm run lint` to check for errors or `npm run lintfix` to automatically fix errors when possible.
7. [Publish](https://docs.npmjs.com/packages-and-modules/contributing-packages-to-the-registry) your package to npm.
